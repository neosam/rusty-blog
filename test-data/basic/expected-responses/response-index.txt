   <h1><a href="http://localhost:2536/post/2019-11-24-first-post.html"> New blog</a></h1>    
    <p>Once again, I try to start to run a new blog.  But now, I write my own blog
software.  Well I know this is nonsense since there is already a lot of much
better weblog software out there and what I write doesn’t add any value.</p>
<p>So, why am I doing this?  I try to get some more experience with Rust in
web development.  For a basic blogging software, I just needed 236 lines of
code.  And currently it provides these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Threaded web server thanks to actix-web.</li>
<li>Templating system to create custom themes thanks to tinytemplate.</li>
<li>Static file share to host css files.</li>
<li>Display posts which are stored as markdown files thanks to the markdown
library.</li>
<li>Display a list of posts.</li>
<li>And loggging! (= env_logger)</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of very important features are still missing.  For example RSS feeds and
comments.  The implementation I made was not very smart and for example the
template engine gets initialized on every page request.  Since I don’t expect
many visitors on this page, this is good enough for now but this needs to be
fixed.  Hopefully I can make an update in 2019.</p>
<p>The code is available at <a href="https://github.com/neosam/rusty-blog" title="Github">https://github.com/neosam/rusty-blog</a></p>
